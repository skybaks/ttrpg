Starting on Audion Station. Vance Vega got ditched by their crew because they didnt want to fly with him anymore.
Dr Pepper ran into some medical practice issues and left to find some new test subjects. Lance got ditched by their
crew because they were binge drinking at the bar. Jance is an ex-colonial marshal traveling mysteriously.

Vance put out a posting for a new crew and then has everyone meet up at the millipede inn.
Rando crew people: Jet Kampf, Boone Watanabe (Former Colonial Marine), Leah Melkor, Fleur Ducote (Former Private Security).

The crew sign up for the ship salvage of PARADISO GALACTICA - RECOVER BLACK BOX OF SPACE-LINER POSIEDON. 50,000 AND TOTAL SALVAGE RIGHTS

The last know position of the ship was departing from GL199A - GIMENO STATION and it was heading to GJ2066 - ANCHORPOINT STATION. It was last seen near the ETA LEPORIS system. It has been less than 1 week since their last contact.
The corporation contact for this contract is Bryce Rooksen. From him we learn that there were 145 crew memebers on the ship and approx 1000 passengers onboard at the time of disappearence.
Looking through the last comm data from the ship we dont see anything specifically wrong but something seems quite off about it.
They had 24 colonial marines on board. They are going to send us a maids key. The black box should be in the helm right under the pilots console. We may have to destroy the console to access it.

Valen Kniffen is the corpo guy for the company that owns the loan on our ship.

Vance and Jance are packing iron, Lance has a cool knife that is close to an M9 Bayonet, and Dr P is a psycho killer.
Getting ready to depart, the ship is stocked with enough food for 1 year of eating. Our ship has a supply rating of 3.
