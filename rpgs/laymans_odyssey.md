A man in his late thirties with short blonde hair swept back into a short mohawk. His chest, shoulders, and neck are covered in tattoos. He is wearing a greasy mechanics jumpsuit. He has blue eyes, a sharp nose, a small mouth, and smudges of dirt and grease all over his face and hands.

Ship Name: YUMA

Starting on Audion Station. Vance Vega got ditched by their crew because they didnt want to fly with him anymore.
Dr Pepper ran into some medical practice issues and left to find some new test subjects. Lance got ditched by their
crew because they were binge drinking at the bar. Jance is an ex-colonial marshal traveling mysteriously.

Vance put out a posting for a new crew and then has everyone meet up at the millipede inn.
Rando crew people: Jet Kampf, Boone Watanabe (Former Colonial Marine), Leah Melkor, Fleur Ducote (Former Private Security).

The crew sign up for the ship salvage of PARADISO GALACTICA - RECOVER BLACK BOX OF SPACE-LINER POSIEDON. 50,000 AND TOTAL SALVAGE RIGHTS

The last know position of the ship was departing from GL199A - GIMENO STATION and it was heading to GJ2066 - ANCHORPOINT STATION. It was last seen near the ETA LEPORIS system. It has been less than 1 week since their last contact.
The corporation contact for this contract is Bryce Rooksen. From him we learn that there were 145 crew memebers on the ship and approx 1000 passengers onboard at the time of disappearence.
Looking through the last comm data from the ship we dont see anything specifically wrong but something seems quite off about it.
They had 24 colonial marines on board. They are going to send us a maids key. The black box should be in the helm right under the pilots console. We may have to destroy the console to access it.

Valen Kniffen is the corpo guy for the company that owns the loan on our ship.

Vance and Jance are packing iron, Lance has a cool knife that is close to an M9 Bayonet, and Dr P is a psycho killer.
Getting ready to depart, the ship is stocked with enough food for 1 year of eating. Our ship has a supply rating of 3.

# session 2

Departing from the station we decide to travel to the target ship while in hypersleep. As we come out of hypersleep we pick up a very faint signal of a ship dead in the water. We also are seeing a smaller vessel right on top of the larger ship but the smaller ship seems to be powered on and very much alive.

We approach silently. Boone IDs them as a typical pirate vessel and it appears that they have rammed and boarded the larger vessel. We decide to sneak in close to the pirate vessel and send Lance out to board.

Lance jumps out of the airlock and lands on the pirate ship. Suddenly a russian accent guy comes on the radio and tells us "DO NOT ENTER THE SHIP." Per the crews direction lance cuts into the ship anyway.

Jance does a scan and we detect one lifeform on the ship. They deploy the docking umbilical and we attach to the pirate ship. Everyone on the YUMA right now heads to the airlock to get ready to board.

Jance jumps into the pirate ship and gets blapped right through the heart dies on the spot. Then Lance and Vance run in, and narrowly dodge getting shot. Lance charges forward and tries to melee the guy with his torch but misses. The guy returns fire but misses Lance. Then Vance takes a shot with his .357 Magnum right through the eyeballs and the guy falls to the ground, dead.

Lance lifts Jance's body and carries it back to the YUMA. Meanwhile, Vance starts to survey the pirate ship's cabin and it looks like it has been lived in for a while. Vance finds a map and a paradiso galactica employee record for a guy named Boris Norodosk.

Everyone heads back to the YUMA to survey the damage to Jance and to gather their wits. After Lance shares a beer with the boys (plus doc) Lance and Vance head back to the paradiso with Boone and Fleur in tow. Vance puts his ear up to the door and hears a faint hoo-hoo-hoo in the distance.

Lance opens the door and heads into the hall followed by Vance, Boone, and Fleur. Lance heads over to the door to the helm and attempts to hack it, but fails. Then he pulls out his torch and starts cutting into it but its not effective.

Suddenly, a random guy opens a door down the hall and runs out into the hall screaming. He is being attacked by a swarm of 20 or so small birdlike creatures. Vance takes a grenade off his belt and chucks it down the hall towards the mess. The grenade goes off and vaporizes both the birds and the guy.

Brian Ryan has been living on the ship, hiding out. He knows that the birds are called Paradisis Galacticus Raptorus. He peeks the door open but closes it again when he sees some birds enter the hall. Boone takes a shot at the birds in the hallway but he misses. Fluer takes a shot at the birds but also misses. Vance takes a shot at the birds but hits a stress and empties his clip.

Lance pushes hard and cuts through the door, he gets an extra succes and is able to take the action of not having to roll again for the same action. Upon entering the helm we are surprised to see that the helm is missing.

The birds appoach Boone and Fluer. Fluer is attacked and killed by the birds. Boone is getting swarmed by the birds as well but is fending them off. Vance dives for fluer's discarded gun but he fails the roll and empties the clip. Lance charges down the hallway with knife in hand and demolishes all the birds.

After the battle Brian creeps out of his room and approaches Vance, Lance, and Boone. Lance takes brian into the helm in hopes that Brian can locate the black box. It looks like the black box was taken out from the helm and taken into a hole that is open in the ceiling.

After learning that the black box is not in the helm, Vance, Brian, and Lance head back to the YUMA to regroup and gather their wits.
