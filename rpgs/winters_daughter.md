All 4 characters meet in the tavern of shermandale and discuss the coming adventure. The innkeeper mentions they know of sir chyde and the tomb must be somewhere in the surrounding woods.
The next day they go into the town market and meet an apple seller who doesnt tell them anything much. Then they talk to big john who trades them a piece of canvas for some wine which he was planning to use to smooth things over with his wife. He tells them about the town historian who may know more about the specifics. They visit the historian who is named trolog and he straightens them out about the lineage of delmont. Then he says that the tomb is located between the mountains and the water, and also that the meeting place of the sir chyde and his lover the princess was near the whything stones which also happens to be between mountains and the water.
They travel into the woods and when evening begins to fall happen upon a gathering of folks from the nearby town of lakeshipton. A man named Brian welcomes them up to their fire and they spend the evening with them telling stories. They sleep there, next to the fire until later that night when 3 of the adventurers are awoken by the crashing sounds of a treant bursting into the clearing.
