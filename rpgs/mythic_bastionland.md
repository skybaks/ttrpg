# details

* Character: Pyter Greysson
* Time: Fall 2022

Mythic bastionland involved a party of four knights traveling through a mystic and unknown land in search of glory and
fame. At the time this took place I had not yet decided to journal my sessions here so the details of this campaign are
pulled from my imperfect memory.

# story and major events

The map of the land of myrth was roughly a square made of smaller hexes. The knights started their adventure in the north east corner. From there they traveled south slightly along a river until they came across a simple fishing village. The people of the village were having a terrible issue being able to get enough food from their fishing trade due to a large influx of herons at their usual fishing spot.

These herons were usually kept in check by their huntsman, however, the huntsman had recently lost his dog and left several days ago to go looking for it. After staying the night in the village the knights set out to the west in search of either the huntsman or his dog.

They traveled for at least a few days and finally came upon a large dead tree on a hill where they found a small boy and an injured dog. Assuming this was the huntsman's dog they convinced the boy to let them have the dog. They also took the boy on one of their horses.

Riding hard through the night they brought both the dog and boy back to the village, except the boy mysteriously vanished during the night ride through the woods and there was no trace of him. With his dog returned to him and being nursed back to health the huntsman was happy to resume his duties keeping the pesky heron population in check.

During their stay in this fishing village the knights heard of a grand tournament taking place at a central capitol city known as the red court. Therefore, after staying the night they set out southward towards this stronghold. After traveling for some time they came upon a monastary at the foot of an impassible mountain range.

Silent monks came out of the monastary and lead their horses to stables as well as showed each knight to a room. They stayed the night there and in the morning were summed to breakfast where they met with the seer of lost things who told them basically nothing about anything despite their best efforts. She did offer to lend them a monk to guide their way through the mountains and to the red court, which they accepted. She did also request that when they reach the red court they acquire a certain "tincture" and return it to her (she was a drug addict).

The knights set off across the mountains with a single silent monk as their guide. The crossing is largely uneventful except for a single odd instance of several lost pets suddenly running past the group and then disappearing. After this one of the knights bent down and picked up a small piece wood with some carved runes.

The monk left the company of the knights at the foot of the mountains and they continued west toward the red court. Upon arriving at the red court they found many other knights and people gathered for the tournament. The gates of the city have been closed and The Sultana (leader of red court) is not admitting anyone into the city except by direct invite. The knights hang around the goings-on outside the city but they cant seem to get any traction with getting into the city. They do run across one armorsmith who tells them tales of a hidden city in the northwest and an unknown evil.

Since no one around the red court seems to know what is going on or when the tournament is going to start the knights decide to head south in search of adventure. They travel for a day and then decide to make camp and try their hand at some hunting. They head into the woods and come across the tracks of a boar. Following that leads them to the boar itself which upon seeing them it turns to defend itself. It charges one of the knights and guts his horse wide open, knocking him to the ground. Another of the knights has their horse spooked and it runs off in the woods, with him on it. The remaining two knights dismount their steeds and begin an attack. The other three knights are eventually able to slay the boar and haul its carcass back to their camp.

They stay the night and then set off for the nearest village with the boar in tow. When they reach the city they stop at the nearest tavern. All knights but one order drinks and drink them. It turns out the drinks in this town are a known hallucinogenic. While the other three knight are tripping balls the one knight quickly takes the boar to another nearby city where he trades it for a cool new horse to replace the one that was killed during the fight with the boar.

He returns from the other city just as his companions are coming down off their trip. That morning word has been going around the city that the tournament at the red court is starting soon so they decide to head back that way.
