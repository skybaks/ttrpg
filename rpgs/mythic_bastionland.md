# details

* Character: Pyter Greysson
* Time: Fall 2022

Mythic bastionland involved a party of four knights traveling through a mystic and unknown land in search of glory and
fame. At the time this took place I had not yet decided to journal my sessions here so the details of this campaign are
pulled from my imperfect memory.

# story and major events

The map of the land of myrth was roughly a square made of smaller hexes. The knights started their adventure in the north east corner. From there they traveled south slightly along a river until they came across a simple fishing village. The people of the village were having a terrible issue being able to get enough food from their fishing trade due to a large influx of herons at their usual fishing spot.

These herons were usually kept in check by their huntsman, however, the huntsman had recently lost his dog and left several days ago to go looking for it. After staying the night in the village the knights set out to the west in search of either the huntsman or his dog.

They traveled for at least a few days and finally came upon a large dead tree on a hill where they found a small boy and an injured dog. Assuming this was the huntsman's dog they convinced the boy to let them have the dog. They also took the boy on one of their horses.

Riding hard through the night they brought both the dog and boy back to the village, except the boy mysteriously vanished during the night ride through the woods and there was no trace of him. With his dog returned to him and being nursed back to health the huntsman was happy to resume his duties keeping the pesky heron population in check.

During their stay in this fishing village the knights heard of a grand tournament taking place at a central capitol city known as the red court. Therefore, after staying the night they set out southward towards this stronghold. After traveling for some time they came upon a monastary at the foot of an impassible mountain range.

Silent monks came out of the monastary and lead their horses to stables as well as showed each knight to a room. They stayed the night there and in the morning were summed to breakfast where they met with the seer of lost things who told them basically nothing about anything despite their best efforts. She did offer to lend them a monk to guide their way through the mountains and to the red court, which they accepted. She did also request that when they reach the red court they acquire a certain "tincture" and return it to her (she was a drug addict).

The knights set off across the mountains with a single silent monk as their guide. The crossing is largely uneventful except for a single odd instance of several lost pets suddenly running past the group and then disappearing. After this one of the knights bent down and picked up a small piece wood with some carved runes.

The monk left the company of the knights at the foot of the mountains and they continued west toward the red court. Upon arriving at the red court they found many other knights and people gathered for the tournament. The gates of the city have been closed and The Sultana (leader of red court) is not admitting anyone into the city except by direct invite. The knights hang around the goings-on outside the city but they cant seem to get any traction with getting into the city. They do run across one armorsmith who tells them tales of a hidden city in the northwest and an unknown evil.

Since no one around the red court seems to know what is going on or when the tournament is going to start the knights decide to head south in search of adventure. They travel for a day and then decide to make camp and try their hand at some hunting. They head into the woods and come across the tracks of a boar. Following that leads them to the boar itself which upon seeing them it turns to defend itself. It charges one of the knights and guts his horse wide open, knocking him to the ground. Another of the knights has their horse spooked and it runs off in the woods, with him on it. The remaining two knights dismount their steeds and begin an attack. The other three knights are eventually able to slay the boar and haul its carcass back to their camp.

They stay the night and then set off for the nearest village with the boar in tow. When they reach the city they stop at the nearest tavern. All knights but one order drinks and drink them. It turns out the drinks in this town are a known hallucinogenic. While the other three knight are tripping balls the one knight quickly takes the boar to another nearby city where he trades it for a cool new horse to replace the one that was killed during the fight with the boar.

He returns from the other city just as his companions are coming down off their trip. That morning word has been going around the city that the tournament at the red court is starting soon so they decide to head back that way.

On their way back to the red court they encounter a strange goblin-like creature in the woods which offers them a very nice sword in exchange for a future favor. The knights see that the sword is very showy and think that they could probably make use of that to make waves at the red court so they accept the deal. A mark appears on each one of their hands and the goblin vanishes.

They arrive back at the red court just in time to hear the announcement from The Sultana. The tournament is going to be a contest of who can perform the greatest, most heroic, and knighly deed. The duration will be until the first snows of winter. Upon hearing this the knights set out south to find an adventure.

They travel south for many days heading towards a large castle in the south west of the land of myrth. Along the way they come across an abandoned farmhouse in a large field. Searching inside the farmhouse they dont immediately find anything of note. Some of the party heads to the barn and inside finds a the bloody carcass of a cow that looks like its udder has burst but instead of milk coming out it appears there is honey instead. Going back into the house they discover a basement which contains several jars of the same kind of honey from the barn. They grab a couple jars of the honey and head out.

Leaving that place they continue southward towards the castle. After some time they happen upon a party of knights accompanied by a large wolf and a seer. In discussion with the group they learn that the group of knights is traveling in search of The Child in order to protect The City. Our four knights offer their services to help out in the search but are uncharitably scoffed at by the larger group.

Continuing further south they finally reach the castle they were heading towards. Approaching the castle they notice a large amount of rats. When they draw near the castle a man appears on the ramparts who tells them he is the rat lord and this castle is called the rat keep. They ask him for admittance to the keep but he refuses on the grounds that they are not rats (which is true). One of the knights has a pet rat companion which has been traveling with him all this time. Upon hearing that this rat keep is a home for rats he decides the right thing would be to set his pet rat free to live inside the keep which he does.

After being turned away by the rat lord they turn their travels eastward toward the other castle in the south of myrth. Along the way they happen upon a young man on the side of the road who quickly hails them down and tells them he has just been attacked by bandits and his cart along with shipment of wine has been stolen. The knights rush into action with 3 of them scouting forward in the direction of the bandits while one stays behind with the horses. The 3 knights confirm the location of the bandits and the wine cart then return to reconvene with the 4th knight at the horses. They decide upon the plan of a sneak attack and all four of them set off, leaving the horses to the young man.

The sneaking is going quite well until they get close and the bandits spot them in the trees. There are 2 (3?) bandits on the ground and 1 up in a tree with a bow. The knights each attack one of the bandits on the ground while the archer in the tree fires arrows from on high. One of the knights falls in the grueling battle which ensues. The remaining knights manage to slay all of the bandits on the ground and the one in the tree runs off, scared. They return the stolen wine to the young man on the road and the spend some time mourning their fallen comrade.

Continuing east they come upon a house on a hill which is very brightly lit. Some villagers are running away in fear and they look quite mad. There is a female knight standing at the bottom of the hill who introduces themselves to the party. The knights approach carefully until they are close enough to look in the window of the house. Inside they see a woman made of fire rocking a baby crib while hearing the sound of crying. Suddenly the woman turns and sees them, then she activates rage mode and goes supernova. All the knights who were looking at the woman are brought to their knees in absolute pain. Some of the knights who were not looking at the woman see their friends struck down and react by dragging their bodies down the hill back towards the horses. When they are close enough to the horses they drag them onto the horses and ride hard until they are a safe distance away.

Their riding eventually brings them to the shore of a lake where they stop and make camp. Some of the knights are still very sick and feverish from their interaction with the fire woman. One of the knights rides out towards the middle of the lake, which is actually quite shallow, and finds an island with a child on it that has pure black eyes. It turns out that this child is actually The Child. The Child calls over the other sick knights and is able to heal them with a thought. Then suddenly the goblin posesses one of the knights and strikes down The Child.

Following that the knights look down at their hands and see that the goblin's mark has faded away. They stand and gather their wits until they see that the seer from before is approaching them. The seer thanks the knights for their valiant work defending The City by killing The Child. To aid the seer, the knights offer the gift of one of their horses (since they have one extra). The seer accepts and continues on their travels.

The knights head further east and encounter a couple of knights having what looks like a trade disagreement with some farmers over the sale of a horse. Our valiant heros attempt to intervene at which point the other knights turn agressively towards them. These other knights are no joke also, they have armor that is built to look like a castle ("crenellations" and all) and it absorbs hits like a castle as well. They go full on agression and our four knights are caught in a battle. During the battle on of our knights is killed while the other castle knight is only gravely wounded. After the castle knight is gravely wounded another larger knight comes out of a nearby house, and fearing for their lives the remaining three knights in the party decide to make a run for it.

They escape successfully but decide that those castle knights are probably from the other southern castle and that they would probably not be welcome there for attacking some of their castle knights. Instead they head back west, stopping by the rat keep to say hi. Going further west they travel through a thick forest before returning to open fields.

They encounter a strange, somewhat crazed man running in the opposite direction who raves something about the dead walking. Shortly after that they enter a village where everyone is currently praying in a church. The knights stay in that village on night but when asking around about the dead walking no one there seems to know anything about it. They also seem surprised by the idea of a thick forest surrounding their village, no one seems to think this exists. The knights spend the night considering their options for accomplishing a knightly deed of great valor and land on the idea of searching for the hidden village in the north.

In the morning they leave the village heading back east and eventually turn north. They do not see the same thick forest as they ride away from the village.
